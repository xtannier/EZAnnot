# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added

### Changed

- Fix issue in processing of recursive rules in the terminology files
- Fix bug when a word overlaps two sections

- Fix rule parsing with extra spaces around parentheses

## [0.3] 2021-06-09

### Added 

- Add a CHANGELOG

### Changed 

- Fix apostrophe problem (1. terms ending with an apostrophe were not handled properly, 2. Windows apostrophe was only handled in terminologies, not documents)
- Fix bug in Brat schema (annotation.conf contained the element name instead of the element id)
- Fix minor bugs (rule declaration with extra spaces, better handling of empty lines in Excel files)
- Short terms (i.e identified as "term" in the Excel terminology but shorter than 5 characters) are now case-insensitive (but still don't allow approximate matching)
- No more warning when two entities overlap
- Improve error logging during Excel file parsing
- Strip spaces around regex matchings (even if the regex matches spaces before or after the matched expressions, the final result contains no surrounding spaces)


## [0.2] 2021-04-23

### Added
- spaCy V3 support

### Changed 

- Move configuration file to an object module, so that several configuration files can be used for different project, without having to clone the entire ezannot package
